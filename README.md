Static Node.js and Express Site
This is a portfolio built with express and node.js. I am also using PUG templates to render pages. I am going for exceeds on this project.

Extra Credit:
1. npm start runs the app
2. Pug error templates exist for error and page-not-found
3. I added a custom.css file that adds text shadows, box shadows and pulses the error message red.
